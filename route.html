                        <h3>THE JUPITER</h3>
                        <p>Jupiter has a long history surprising scientists—all the way back to 1610 when Galileo
                            Galilei
                            found
                            the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe. Fifth in
                            line
                            from
                            the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – combined. Jupiter's
                            familiar
                            stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an
                            atmosphere
                            of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth
                            that
                            has
                            raged for hundreds of years.</p>

                            <p>As a gas giant, Jupiter doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases
                                and liquids. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Jupiter, it wouldn’t be
                                able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside
                                the planet crush, melt and vaporize spacecraft trying to fly into the planet.</p>

                            <p>Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures,
                                pressures and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and
                                volatile for organisms to adapt to. While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living
                                things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons. Europa is one of
                                the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar system. There is evidence of a
                                vast ocean just beneath its icy crust, where life could possibly be supported.</p>

                        <h3>THE MOON</h3>
                        <p>The Moon is a differentiated world. This means that it is composed of different layers with
                            different compositions. The heaviest materials have sunken down into the Moon’s center, and
                            the lightest materials have risen to the outermost layer. Seismic, rotational, and gravity
                            measurement studies have allowed us to gain insights into the different layers within the
                            Moon.At the center is the Moon’s dense, metallic core. The core is largely composed of iron
                            and some nickel. The inner core is a solid mass about 480 km in diameter. Surrounding the
                            solid inner core is a fluid outer core, that brings the total diameter of the core to about
                            660 km. The Moon’s core is small (about 20% of the Moons diameter) as opposed to other
                            terrestrial worlds (like the Earth) with cores measuring closer to 50% of their diameters

                            <p>Earth's Moon has a core, mantle, and crust.

                                The Moon’s core is proportionally smaller than other terrestrial bodies' cores. The
                                solid, iron-rich inner core is 149 miles (240 kilometers) in radius. It is surrounded by
                                a liquid iron shell 56 miles (90 kilometers) thick. A partially molten layer with a
                                thickness of 93 miles (150 kilometers) surrounds the iron core.

                                The mantle extends from the top of the partially molten layer to the bottom of the
                                Moon's crust. It is most likely made of minerals like olivine and pyroxene, which are
                                made up of magnesium, iron, silicon, and oxygen atoms.

                            <p>During the initial exploration of the Moon, and the analysis of all the returned samples
                                from the Apollo and the Luna missions, we thought that the surface of the Moon was dry.
                                The first definitive discovery of water was made in 2008 by the Indian mission
                                Chandrayaan-1, which detected hydroxyl molecules spread across the lunar surface and
                                concentrated at the poles. Missions such as Lunar Prospector, LCROSS, and Lunar
                                Reconnaissance Orbiter, have not only shown that the surface of the Moon has global
                                hydration, but there are actually high concentrations of ice water in the permanently
                                shadowed regions of the lunar poles.</p>

                        <h3>THE MARS</h3>
                        <p>​Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin
                            atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct
                            volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past. Mars is one of the most
                            explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to
                            roam the alien landscape. Two NASA rovers and one lander are currently exploring the surface
                            of Mars (and a Chinese lander is set to land later this year). An international fleet of
                            eight orbiters are studying the Red Planet from above.

                            <p>The Red Planet is actually many colors. At the surface, we see colors such as brown,
                                gold, and tan. The reason Mars looks reddish is due to oxidization—or rusting—of iron in
                                the rocks, regolith (Martian “soil”), and dust of Mars. This dust gets kicked up into
                                the atmosphere and from a distance makes the planet appear mostly red.

                                Interestingly, while Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its surface has nearly
                                the same area as Earth’s dry land. Its volcanoes, impact craters, crustal movement, and
                                atmospheric conditions such as dust storms have altered the landscape of Mars over many
                                years, creating some of the solar system's most interesting topographical features.

                                A large canyon system called Valles Marineris is long enough to stretch from California
                                to New York—more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers). This Martian canyon is 200 miles
                                (320 kilometers) at its widest and 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) at its deepest. That's about

                        <h3>THE SATURN</h3>
                        <p>​Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system.
                            Adorned with a dazzling system of icy rings, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not
                            the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Like
                            fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.

                            Surrounded by more than 60 known moons, Saturn is home to some of the most fascinating
                            landscapes in our solar system. From the jets of water that spray from Enceladus to the
                            methane lakes on smoggy Titan, the Saturn system is a rich source of scientific discovery
                            and still holds many mysteries.

                            The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known
                            since ancient times. The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who
                            was also the father of Jupiter.

                            <p>As a gas giant, Saturn doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases
                                and liquids deeper down. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it
                                wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures
                                deep inside the planet crush, melt and vaporize spacecraft trying to fly into the
                                planet.

                            <h4>POTENTIAL FOR LIFE</h4>
                            <p>Saturn's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures
                                and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for
                                organisms to adapt to.

                                While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not
                                true of some of its many moons. Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal
                                oceans, could possibly support life.</p>
